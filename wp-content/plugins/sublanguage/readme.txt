Sublanguage is a lightweight multilanguage plugin for wordpress.

== Description ==

Sublanguage is a multilanguage plugin for wordpress.

= Concept =

- no duplicated content (untranslated or untranslatable data inherits main language value)
- no additional database table (translation data is stored in post_meta)
- no markup added into content (unlike q-translate)
- no cookies (language is defined solely by URLs, better for SEO)

= Features =

- [NEW] support for Gutenberg (beta feature)
- translation UI for posts content, title, permalink, excerpt and meta (for posts, pages and custom posts)
- translation UI for terms name, slug, description and meta
- translation UI for attachments title, caption, description, alt and meta
- translation UI for nav menus
- translation UI for options
- translate localized text
- translate login, password change, etc.
- translatability: define which content is translatable or not
- URL rewrite: translate posts and terms permalinks and child pages path
- support revisions
- support multisite
- extendable

= Documentation =

Plugin documentation is available on [github](https://github.com/maximeschoeni/sublanguage)

= Extensions =

- [Sublanguage Switcher Widget](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sublanguage-switcher-widget/) by [Ralf Geschke](https://profiles.wordpress.org/geschke)

== Installation ==

Upload and activate the plugin

Add languages

1. click the "Languages" tab
2. click the "Add language" sub-tab
3. choose a language in the list. If it is not in the list, you can just pick any one, then edit the language title, slug and locale code (xx_XX) later
4. choose the language order (it will affect order in the language switch)
5. click "Publish". If you want to keep the language hidden on the front-end while you edit the translations, you can click "Save draft" instead

Add a language switch on the site (within a menu)

1. click the "Appearance" tab
2. click the "Menus" sub-tab. 
3. choose or create a menu
4. click "Screen Options" (top right) and verify "Language" is checked
5. open the "language" tab on the left, check the checkbox and click "Add to Menu". Repeat it once for every language.
6. if you want to organize the language items hierarchically, with the current language as root, you also need to go in the Sublanguage Settings and check "Current language first" checkbox.

Add a language switch in a widgets zone

1. click the "Appearance" tab
2. click the "Widgets" sub-tab
3. Drag "Sublanguage" item in the zone you want

Add a language switch anywhere on the site (for developpers)

1. Use this function: `do_action('sublanguage_print_language_switch');`. You can customize HTML output through the filter "sublanguage_custom_switch" (read FAQ for more info).

Add translatable custom post types or custom taxonomies
Plugins or themes may add any number of extra post-type and extra taxonomies. If you can't figure wether a post type or taxonomy need to be translatable, please ask in the forum.

1. click the "Settings" tab
2. click the "Sublanguage" sub-tab
3. select every post type and every taxonomy you need. For better performance, only select translatable post types and taxonomies.
4. click "Save Change"
5. click "Option" link after a post type or taxonomy to access specific options

Translate menu items when your menu is using custom links or item names different from page titles

1. click the "Settings" tab
2. click the "Sublanguage" sub-tab
3. select "Navigation Menu Items" in "Translate Post Type" section
4. click "Save Change"
5. click "Edit translations" after "Navigation Menu Items" in "Translate Post Type" section
6. find the items you need to translate and click to edit

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to clean uninstall this plugin? =

In menu click on `Languages`, remove all language custom posts and empty trash. Deleting a language will permanently delete all translations 
associated to this language. Deleting main language will not delete original posts.

= How to add a language switch on template file ? =

Add this function in your template file

	do_action('sublanguage_print_language_switch');
	
= How to customize the language switch output? =

Add this in your `function.php` file and customize it:

	add_action('sublanguage_custom_switch', 'my_custom_switch', 10, 2); 

	/**
	 * @param array of WP_Post language custom post
	 * @param Sublanguage_site $this The Sublanguage instance.
	 */
	function my_custom_switch($languages, $sublanguage) {

	?>
	<ul>
	<?php foreach ($languages as $language) { ?>
		<li class="<?php echo $language->post_name; ?> <?php if ($sublanguage->current_language->ID == $language->ID) echo 'current'; ?>">
			<a href="<?php echo $sublanguage->get_translation_link($language); ?>"><?php echo $language->post_title; ?></a>
		</li>
	<?php } ?>
	</ul>
	<?php 

	}

= How to have language switch in navigation menus ? =

If you are using menus and you want the language switch into a menu, 
go to Display > Menu, open option drawer and verify 'language' is selected. 
Then add as much 'language item' as you have languages.
You can even distribute languages on different hierarchy level.
If you need current language to be on the first level and further language on the second, you will also want to check `current language first` in `Settings -> Sublanguage`

= Post title, content or excerpt does not translate as expected in my theme =

First go to `Sublanguage>Settings` and verify the relevant post type is set to be translatable.

Then verify you are using the proper filters in you template file.

For echoing post title, you need to ensure ´the_title´ filter is called.

	// echoing post title inside the loop
	the_title();
	
	// echoing post title outside the loop
	echo get_the_title($some_post->ID);
	
	// but...
	echo $post->post_title;	// -> Does not translate

For echoing post content, you need to ensure ´the_content´ filter is called.

	// echoing content inside the loop
	the_content();
	
	// or...
	echo apply_filters('the_content', get_the_content());

	// but...
	echo $post->post_content; // -> Does not translate
	echo get_the_content(); // -> Does not translate
	
	// echoing post content outside the loop:
	echo apply_filters('sublanguage_translate_post_field', $some_post->post_content, $some_post, 'post_content');
	
Same for Excerpts.

Permalinks are automatically translated, inside or outside the loop: 
	
	// echoing permalink
	echo get_permalink($post->ID);

= Some texts in my theme do not translate as expected, like 'Comment', 'Leave a Reply', etc. =

In your template files, verify texts are [properly localized](https://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers), and language packages are properly installed.

= How can I access the current language for custom usage? =

Use the global `$sublanguage`, like this:

	global $sublanguage;
	echo $sublanguage->current_language // -> WP_Post object
	echo $sublanguage->current_language->post_title; // -> Français
	echo $sublanguage->current_language->post_name; // -> fr
	echo $sublanguage->current_language->post_content; // -> fr_FR

Alternatively you can use a sublanguage filter to call a user function with `$current_language` value in parameters:

Function to use in your template file: 

	echo apply_filters('sublanguage_custom_translate', 'text to translate', 'my_custom_translation', 'optional value');

Code to add in your `function.php` file:

	/**
	 * @param string $original_text. Original text to translate.
	 * @param WP_Post object $current_language
	 * @param mixed $args. Optional arguments
	 */
	function my_custom_translation($original_text, $current_language, $optional_arg) {
	
		if ($current_language->post_name == 'fr') {
			
			return 'texte traduit en français!';
		
		}
	
		return $original_text;
	
	}

Note: of course, for a basic usage like this, you should use the standard localization way: `__('text to translate', 'my_domain')`.

= How to translate wordpress options like 'blog name' or 'blog description' ? =

Go to `Sublanguage>Translate Options` and try to find the corresponding option key. Options may be nested in a data tree.

= How to translate texts in widgets? =

Go to `Sublanguage>Translate Options` and find the corresponding widget option name (like 'widget_somthing'). Expand items with value corresponding to 'DATA' until you find the text you need to translate.

= How to translate nav menu items? =

Your nav menu items that are linked to translated posts, pages or terms should be automatically translated.

If you need to translate custom link or to change the default value for items name, you can select "Nav Menu Item" in "Translate post types" section of Sublanguage settings.
Then open `Sublanguage>Nav Menu Item` and edit like a normal post.

= How to make a custom post-meta value translatable? =

Go to Sublanguage settings and select custom post-meta key in the checkbox list under "Translate Meta". A meta key needs to be at least used once to appear in this list.

= How to make post thumbnails translatable (different picture for each language)? =

Go to Sublanguage settings and select '_thumbnail_id' in the checkbox list under "Translate Meta". At least one thumbnail must be set before metakey appears in this list.

= How to access language data in javascript for ajax usage ? =

Add this action to enqueue a small script to define values in javascript:

	add_action('init', 'my_init');

	function my_init() {
		
		do_action('sublanguage_prepare_ajax');
		
	}
	
This will first define a global in javascript. Use `console.log(sublanguage)` to explore it.

Furthermore, a small script will automatically add a language attribute in every jquery ajax call. You can change this language using `sublanguage.current` (in javascript). This language will be used if you need to get/update posts/terms using ajax.

= How to import/export my blog with translations ? =

You cannot export or import using the wordpress builtin tool while Sublanguage is active. It just does not work yet. But this feature will come in a future release.

If you want to create a custom importer for posts and terms, you can use these 2 functions:

    do_action( 'sublanguage_import_post', $data);
    do_action( 'sublanguage_import_term', $taxonomy, $data);
    
These functions are documented in sublanguage/include/admin.php. See examples on [github](https://github.com/maximeschoeni/sublanguage#import-posts-and-terms).

= Will this plugin affect my site performance? =

Yes it will, unfortunately. A few more database queries are necessary to load every page.
If performance drops noticeably, you may want to install a cache plugin. Sublanguage have been sucessfully tested with [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/) and [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/) (with default settings).

Sublanguage also works with [SQLite Integration plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sqlite-integration/).

= My language is not in the language list =

Use any language instead, then update, then edit language title, slug and locale, then update again.
